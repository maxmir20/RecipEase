# RecipEase!

A quick and easy JavaScript extension that skips straight to the recipe/ingredients list, avoiding all the unneccesary preamble!

I made this because I was sick of always having to read about everyone's aunt's favorite autumn whatever before getting to the real nitty gritty of the recipe. This skips past all of it.
